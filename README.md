# MQTT -- An API for using MQTT over multiple transports

This library originated from https://os.mbed.com/teams/mqtt/code/MQTT/ but has been extended to include support for the WNC14A2A Cellular
Data module using the wnc14a2a-driver.  

MQTT is now an official spec and information on it can be found at: www.mqtt.org
